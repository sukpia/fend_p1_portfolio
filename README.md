**FEND Project #1: Build a Portfolio Site**

Author: Terri Chong

This is the first project for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nano-Degree (FEND) program. This project is built based on what I have learned about HTML and CSS syntax, and responsive pattern from lesson 1 - 15.

The Portfolio website is responsive on multiple viewports and verified on multiple devices: Windows desktop, Google Nexux 5, and iPad.
